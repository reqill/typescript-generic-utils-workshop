# typescript-generic-utils-workshop

This repository contains the code for the TypeScript Generic Utils Workshop. The workshop is designed to help you understand how to leverage TypeScript generics to create reusable and type-safe utils for your next project.

To run be able to properly set up your environment you should have:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>v20) and added to your PATH
- Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or any other package manager of your choice
- Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the root of the project or equivalent command in your package manager

To fully take advantage of your editor I recommend using VSCode (or Github Workspace) with the following extensions:

- Twoslash Query Comments
- Pretty TypeScript Errors
